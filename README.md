# Buddhabrot
A c++ program to generate images using the "Buddhabrot" algorithm, a modified version of the Mandelbrot pattern. This code is a new version of a Matlab project I worked on a number of years ago, in a (eventually successful) attempt to make the algorithm more efficient to be able to make print quality images.
